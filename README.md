## Batnode Prototype


## To Do

1. File distribution and retrieval use Kademlia nodes to locate target BatNodes
2. Cli integrates with new file distribution and retrieval methods
3. Duplicates of each shard are created and distributed for data redundancy
4. Shards can be audited by the data owner*
5. Data format of shard transfer is changed to remove the limitations of JSON
6. Kademlia nodes can communicate behind different NATs
7. Kademlia nodes broker connections between BatNodes so that BatNodes can communicate behind different NATs

## Specification

#### Upload Single File

kd = kad node
bt = bat node
tkd = target kad node
tbt = target bat node

1. kd performs an iterativeFindNode for <= k kd nodes w/ closest ids to file id
2. kd returns those nodes contacts to bt
3. bt iterates through contacts until the following subroutine succeeds:
4. For each target kad node (tkd):
5. bt asks kd to send a broker_connectionRPC to tkd. Broker connection's payload is bt public conect tuple
6. tkd receives RPC and tells its target bat node (tbt) to send establish_connection tcp request to bt tuple
7. tkd simultaneously sends a success RPC to bt, containing tbt's public tuple
8. bt sends establish_connection tcp request to tbt
9. if bt receives the establish_connection request, it sends a standard store_file message in response
10. if tbt is instead the one to receive establish_connection request, it sends a ready_to_store message in response, and bt responds to that with standard store_file message
11. if bt does not receive a response with X amount of time, move onto the next tkd and try again, else, cease iteration
12. when tbt finishes receiving file, it initiates an iterative store on its tkd

Edge cases:
 - The node doesn't have enough allocated storage
 - The nodes are already connected from previous exchange, so both establish_connection requests go through, causing the file to be sent over twice

### Demos

#### 1: Write a file across two nodes in a LAN.

`node1` will write to `node2`, which resides in another directory.

Starting condition:  
- `demo/batnode1/hosted` has an `example.txt` file.
- Delete any files in `demo/batnode2/hosted`.

1) cd into `demo/batnode1`
2) run `node batnode.js`
3) open a new terminal session and `cd` into `demo/batnode2`
4) run `node batnode.js`

Ending condition: `demo/batnode2/hosted` has a `example.txt-1` file.

#### 2: Distribute shards to multiple server nodes

client node distributes shards to two server nodes

Starting condition:
- `demo/demo_upload/client-node/personal` has an `example.txt` and `test.pdf`
- `demo/demo_upload/server-node` and `server-node-2` directories have an `example.txt` and `test.pdf` files

1) `cd` into `demo/demo_upload/server-node`, and run `node batnode.js`. That server is now running.
2) Open a new terminal session, and `cd` into `demo/demo_upload/server-node-2` and do the same.
3) `cd` into `demo/demo_upload/client-node` and run `node batnode.js`

There should now be:
- shards files in `demo/demo_upload/client-node/shards`
- A manifest file in `demo/demo_upload/client-node/manifest`
- 4 (with current settings) shards in `demo/demo_upload/server-node/hosted` and `server-node-2/hosted`.

Run `git clean -xf` to have all the files generated by the demo wiped.
